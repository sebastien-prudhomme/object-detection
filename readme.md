The repository contains two folders:

- `/api`, the code of the API taking care of detecting objects on images, powered by Tensorflow
- `/app`, the code of the frontend website, powered by Next.js

## Development

Running the API locally:

```
yarn --cwd api run dev
```

Running the app locally:

```

```
